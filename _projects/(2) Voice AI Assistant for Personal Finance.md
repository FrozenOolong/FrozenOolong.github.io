Hackathon Project | Built in a weekend using [Lovable (Vibe Coding)](https://lovable.dev/), [ElevenLabs Voice AI](https://elevenlabs.io/) and Supabase

This project explores how conversational voice AI can enhance personal finance management. It was developed for a hackathon challenge to prototype a GenAI-driven personal finance assistant leveraging Lovable (for rapid web app generation) and ElevenLabs (for natural voice interaction).

### 🚀 Learnings from Vibe Coding with Lovable

1. **Design-first approach:**
   Shifted from spending 80% of time coding → 80% clarifying product value, user flow, and feature communication.
2. **Architecture & organization:**
   Plan data schema and folder structure upfront for easier maintenance and debugging.
3. **Collaborative debugging:**
   Lovable’s integration with GitHub and automatic deployment feedback loop is powerful, but manual intervention is often needed to resolve complex bugs.
4. **UI evolution challenges:**
   Small visual tweaks (fonts, colors) can ripple unexpectedly—precise prompting and version control are essential.
5. **Data clarity matters:**
   Providing explicit schema examples helps Lovable’s AI understand and generate more reliable database code.
