  description: After my undergraduate study in Marketing and several work experiences in digital marketing area,
              I noticed the gap between the mass data companies have and little knowledge marketers can capture and apply 
              to marketing initiatives. I decided to move to data science area and be the marketer in data science who can 
              deliver the 'last-mile' data solutions to businesses. Being able to understand marketing focus and data analysis
              allow me to transale business needs and problems into data solutions, and create values for businesses through data insights.
