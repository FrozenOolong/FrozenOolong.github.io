<br/>
Having your website sometimes is quite similar as having a car: buying it is just the step 1. You need to check how your ‘car’ is running, evaluate its performance, and conduct maintenance to keep it shiny and lovely. Here are five free online tools that you can use to check your website performance and help you to identify areas of improvement.
<br/>
<br/>
### Website Load Time
<br/>

Back in 2009, [Google](https://ai.googleblog.com/2009/06/speed-matters.html) already identified that 100 to 400 milliseconds delay in page load lead to 0.2% – 0.6% reduction in the number of searches per user. With customers having less attention span, a slow webpage can easily make you lose their interest and make them switch to other pages.

### Website Design & Layout
<br/>

Albeit the tools recommended above provide you with metrics of your website, it is difficult for computers to evaluate how your website is viewed by human users. There are websites that paid users to evaluate website and provide feedbacks, yet you can evaluate by yourself or others.

+ Check website in both desktop and mobile and check each button/link and visuals
+ Identify people that are much alike to your target customers (e.g. similar age, usage preference) and ask their opinion and feedback
+ Check your competitors’ websites and see what works and what you could’ve done to improve

I hope these recommended tools can help you to do a “health check” on your website and provide you with some guidance on how to improve the website. If you want to further identify and design your website improvement plan, reach out to our consultants for a free digital consultation.
