Graduated during the pandemic is probably one of the countless moments that I think “Ah, I knew Option A was the right one!”. Unfortunately, life does not work like video games, and no such saving points or records available for me to go back to the previous saving point and alter my option selection. During the hardest job applying season, how to utilize LinkedIn to land a job effectively becomes a key skill to acquire. I just finished [the LinkedIn Guy courses]( https://www.linkedinguys.com/) and Their [YouTube Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMBq7Dpa14U&feature=youtu.be) and I would like to share the key learning from the lessons. __~~LinkedIn Guy, if you are reading this, please send advertising fee to me. ;)~~__

### Strategize Your Job Applying Process: The 5-Step Approach
<br/>

The LinkedIn Guy organize their approach in 5 steps:
1.	Explore
2.	Prioritizing
3.	Search for Opportunities
4.	Build Your Network and Knowledge
5.	Research & Do Your Own Check

<br/>
**Explore** step let you discover LinkedIn features, such as turn on the #OpenToWork badge and post to the feed to increase your exposure to recruiters. The second step is **prioritizing**, where you demonstrate your engagement with potential recruiters and optimize your LinkedIn profile to position yourself as the candidates that they are looking for. 


Once your LinkedIn profile is ready, you can **search for opportunities** by adjusting your LinkedIn filter to filter job opportunities and setting up job alerts for jobs you might like. Leveraging your LinkedIn network is also key. **Searching your network**, alumni, and target companies’ employees would be a great first step. Lastly, before your coffee chat/phone call, or even interviews, use LinkedIn’s company page, news, SlideShare to **research the companies**.

### Leverage Your Network for Referrals & Hiring Agents
<br/>

It might not be new to you that applicants with employee referrals get a higher chance of landing the job. In the picture shown below (from [The LinkedIn Guy YouTube talk]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMBq7Dpa14U&feature=youtu.be
)), although only 7% and 2% of total applicants come from employee referral and agency, 40% of candidates with employee referrals and 19% of agency-selected candidates got hired. Finding people in your target companies can help you to get to know more about the companies and get your foot in the door for the companies.

<br/>

For your existing network group, leverage your alumni search to find alumni who are working in your dream companies and reach out to them. If you cannot find anyone, try to use the filter in LinkedIn search to filter down companies, job titles, and connection degree to find people whom you have higher response and success rate if you reach out to. 

<br/>
### Ask Yourself: Will It Help Me Achieve My Goal?
<br/>

The biggest takeaway from the course is the key question that we always need to keep in mind when we are working on our LinkedIn profile. In the LinkedIn Guy Q&A (bonus recourse) section, regarding various questions that people usually ask, such as whether to use LinkedIn premium or new LinkedIn features, they keep bringing back the key question: Will it help me achieve my goal? 

It might seem silly at first to keep reminding yourself of this question. Of course, I want a job or why am I not on Tik Tok but LinkedIn right now? The problem is, we often get lost when working with many things on parallel: optimizing LinkedIn profile, connecting with people, applying for jobs… It is important to know what action items can help you to land a job and how to prioritize your to-do list. Asking yourself this question again and again, when you are making the decision for many tasks you can do during job hunting, can help you to stay focused and find your answer.

### Final Notes
<br/>

As a commerce student, I am familiar with LinkedIn features and always be proud of my all-start profile. Quite a lot of tips and tactics that the LinkedIn Guys share are not new to me. However, the way that they standardize the job searching approach and showcase how recruiters utilize LinkedIn to find candidates are really useful. There are always things you can do on LinkedIn and job searching but your time and effort are limited. Taking the LinkedIn Guys course is a good time to spend way to help you capture the key 20% tasks that help you to land the job effectively (yes, business students’ favour: 20/80 rule). If you still feel uncomfortable to network on LinkedIn or not get any potential job lead through LinkedIn, I would recommend you check out [the LinkedIn Guy courses](https://www.linkedinguys.com/). In their course, they cover more in detail about what a good LinkedIn profile looks like, InMail example when you reach out to others, and tips for international students and job applicants during the pandemic. If you are not sure to pay for it yet, watch their [YouTube talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMBq7Dpa14U&feature=youtu.be) first. 

**Happy Learning! :watermelon:**
