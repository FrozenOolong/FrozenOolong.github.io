People usually think there is a super high math barrier to enter the data science field and it cannot be acquired by self-learning. They are not wrong to some extent. When I first saw some big data or data science courses online, I wasn't sure whether they speak English in the videos or I was simply too dumb to understand any single word. Good thing is, you can still utilize online learning to build your foundation of statistics, mathematics, and programming, which are keys for becoming a data scientist. I like searching and collecting learning resources, just like how squirrels collect pinecones before winter comes. Here are five self-learning sources that I found really useful to enter the data science field.
<br/>
<br/>

### Math
<br/>
[Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) offered by Imperial College London in Coursera
<br/>
It is a specialization in Coursera which includes 3 courses: Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, and PCA. Albeit its title indicates fancy ‘machine learning’, it does not require any machine learning or programming experience and if you still remember your high-school math, you should be able to follow along. The video quality, course structure, and quiz are easy to follow. There is a free audit option that you can access in each course (not under specialization page) if you would like to give it a try without paying a monthly fee.
<br/>

### Statistics
<br/>
If you haven't open your statistics book after high school, you might want to review concepts such as normal distribution, z-score, t-score, or f-score. You can find those in Kham Academy, YouTube, or LinkedIn Learning. If you are looking for a bit more, the [Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) course offered by Stanford University is really useful. It is based on An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Application in R by James Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani (2013) which is a book commonly used for statistic undergraduate/master student. It will help you to build a solid statistical understanding of algorithms you might use in machine learning or data analysis in general. 
<br/>

### Programming
<br/>
In terms of programming, there is two big part of programming: one being the actual coding part, the other one is programming thinking, in other words, algorithms/programming efficiency/programming design.
<br/>

If you just want to have a boot-camp-style coding learning, I would recommend Python:<br/>
- [Learn to Program](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program/home/welcome): The Fundamental offered by the University of Toronto on Coursera. I won’t lie, the video setup is not what I like when you just see professor talking in front of a background cloth. However, the flow and content structure of the course is really good and concise. You would be able to catch up quickly and have a clear understanding of Python in this course.<br/>

- [Python for Data Science Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-for-data-science-essential-training/create-basic-charts?u=76812730) on LinkedIn Learning. It covers common data pre-processing (e.g. data descriptive summary, dealing with missing values, or data aggregation), data visualization, and basic data analysis algorithm. It will give you a quick sense of data analysis on Python. 
<br/>

If you are an absolute beginner, here are my favourite courses to get started with:<br/>
- [CS 50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) offered by HarvardX on EdX. It covers a wide range of topics including website (HTML&CSS), C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript. Sounds a lot? Don’t worry, it is perfect for someone without any programming knowledge to have a basic understanding and fun projects to try around different languages. <br/>
- [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_6+2T2015/course/) offered by MIT on EdX. This course is a first-year course for computer science students. Unlike Harvard’s CS50, it only uses Python but it goes deeper on Python language. I do, however, find it a bit more challenging compared to Harvard’s CS50 course when I just start learning how to code. But it is a really good course to give a real ‘computer science’ sense to start with. 
<br/>

Getting more advanced in computer science:<br/>
- [Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome) offered by Princeton University on Coursera. It is a course targeting to undergraduate computer science students, yet it could be really helpful for coding interviews or advance on your programming.
<br/>
<br/>
That’s it. All learning resources I recommended above do not require anything beyond your high-school learning. I often find it difficult to jump directly into ‘big data analysis’ without a clear understanding of statistics, mathematics, and programming concepts. I hope this could help you to get started on data science. Let’s dig into big data! <br/>
