# **About Me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}** 👩🏻‍💻,<br>

<!-- Personal Summary -->

<p>
A Generative AI Engineer and Data Scientist who loves to build. I've spent the past few years creating AI solutions that turn data into insights and ideas into production. I work across the full stack to bring projects to life, whether it's production systems or side projects I'm experimenting with for fun.
</p>

<p>
I'm always learning, trying new things, and looking for better ways to connect technology with everyday life. Want to talk GenAI, data science, or design? Let's chat.
